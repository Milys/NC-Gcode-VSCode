# nc-gcode

> June 12, 2020
>
> The original extension, [ML.nc-gcode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ML.nc-gcode), is owned and published by [Milys](https://github.com/Milys).  I have had limited communication with the owner and he agreed to add me as a collaborator.  Despite my request, I have not been granted sufficient access to his publisher to get an updated verison of his extension to the marketplace.
>
> My approach to this situation is to create a new extension using a similar publisher id and the same name, `ML2.nc-gcode`.  This new extension will be flagged as a 'preview'.  I'll continue to publish from the `master` branch.
>
> Note that the version in the marketplace is `0.13.0` and the version in the owner's repository is `0.7.0`.  I will be publishing `0.14.0` developing off of `0.7.0`.
